**Two methods**
<br />
**First Method (frequency)**
<br />
We find all frequencies of each letter and check if the t and s have the same frequency

**Second Method (Sorting)**
<br />
We sort the two strings (remember to change them back to the list), and then we can make two arrays in alphabetical order. We can simply check if they are the same.
