Two method
First Method (frequency)
We find all frequency of each letter and check if the t and s have same frequency
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)

Second Method (Sorting)
we sort the two string(remember to change it back to list) then we can make two array that is in alphabetical order we can simplly check if they are same
Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Space Complexity: O(N)
