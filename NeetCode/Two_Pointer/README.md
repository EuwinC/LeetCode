Two Pointer Technique

The two-pointer technique is a powerful method used in coding problems to optimize solutions by reducing time complexity. By employing two pointers instead of one, it eliminates the need for nested loops, often transforming algorithms from O(NÂ²) to O(N) time complexity. This approach is especially effective for problems involving arrays, lists, or strings, making it a key tool for efficient problem-solving in coding interviews.

Common Use Cases and Corresponding Two-Pointer Techniques:
|Use Case|How to use Two Pointer|

|Finding Two Sum in a Sorted Array|Left Right Pointer|
|Palindrome Checking|Left Right Pointer|
|Finding the Size of a Rectangle (e.g., Container With Most Water)|Left Right Pointer|
|Detect Loop|Fast Slow Pointer|
|Merging Two Sorted Arrays|Two pointers for two sequences|
|Sliding Window Problems|Sliding Window|
